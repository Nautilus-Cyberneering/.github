# Hi There üëã --- Welcome to our Organization's GitHub Page

## Who We Are :smiley: :alien: :sunglasses: üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We are currently a small team of people working towards our long term vision. Our vision is to create open source software ecosystems, with a particular focus on AI and Machine Learning solutions.
Our team is both made up of employees and external collaborators. We come from different professional backgrounds and countries.
Most of us are developers but some of us are not.

Things that define us as a team are:

- The believe that everyone can add value
- The constant strive to learn and improve ourselves
- The believe that all we do has an impact on others and our planet
- The convincement that technology has great potential and value for individuals and companies

Essentially, we care for:

- People and the community
- Transparency
- Learning & sharing of knowledge
- The free availability of software and technology through Open-Source software
- The responsible use of technology
- Nature

Given this we operate according to these values and we strive to create value with everything we do and share it with the community.

## Current In-House Expertise ü§ìüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

Our current internal developer employee members have on average more than 15 years of professional experience in the field. Some of the programming languages they have worked with extensively are Java, JS, Typescript, Python, etc. This fact implies also that they are comfortable in using the common related frameworks and tools used within these languages.

In addition, several of them have also worked closely connected to relevant Blockchain implementations, as well as worked on software security for open-source and closed-source projects. All important elements that we will introduce in our projects.

## Growing In-House Expertise üëÄ üß† üìñ üîç

Our skill set is constantly growing as we explore the best ways to realize our long term project. For example when we work on our projects we sometimes take small detours. Such detours are to deepen our knowledge in areas that we consider important.

As it usually is the case, during this process once we understand the topic at a deeper level we discover areas for improvement. An example of this are our Git-Queue and Librarian projects.

The aim of these two spin-off projects are to facilitate automation for repositories which are an essential part for our project. While developing these two we had to deepen our understanding of how Git and GitHub work, and in the process we discovered some possible security enhancements that will benefit all repository users.

## Where are we located :earth_africa:

Our company headquarters are located in Gr√ºnwald, a beautiful small town just outside of Munich, Germany. However, almost all of us are working remotely and we have team members in different countries.
You will find us in Germany, Spain and China.

## Our Journey :rocket:

We just started our journey together in 2021. We have just taken the first steps of our journey to realize our vision.

### Years 2022-2023

We intend to:

- Bring the power of AI directly to the end user on his local desktop with modular extensions and a plaftorm to create these
- Create a community around our product and platform to further develop our vision and make it its own

All this so that the community learns, teaches and drives the direction and evolution of solutions, and this without any external influences.

## Our Projects  :bulb:

Each of our current projects has a specific purpose to address core elements that we need to learn to realize our long term vision.

### Long term Projects Overview  :telescope:  :dart:

This is a link to our [first long-term project's roadmap repository](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/ai_assistant_roadmap).

### Spin-off repositories with potential for general use

Along the way to develop our long term project we will require to develop custom solutions to challenges we face, which nevertheless, may be of use to the others.
The resulting products can take different forms but we list them under each Steppingstone project in a section called spin-offs.

### Current Stepping Stone Projects (SSP) :nut_and_bolt:

With everything we do we attempt to create value from the start.
In this case we are helping a collaborating company in solving one of their needs, and at the same time we are learning about one of the key components that we will require to realize our vision.

1. The Creation of a Simple Media Management System through GitHub Repositories - [read more](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/chinese-ideographs/blob/main/README.md)

Current Objectives:

- Become experts in managing large amounts of interlinked GitHub repositories
- Become experts in GitHub actions and workflows
- Become experts in version control system management for large binaries
- Become experts in Python
- Establish other necessary knowledge that needs to be acquired during the next project
- Solve our collaborator's need

Stage: POC02

## Documentation :page_with_curl: :bar_chart:

All of our projects have documentation specific to themselves, such as contribution guidelines, etc. However, we have some General documentation of interest for contributors that relate to security and using GitHub listed below.

<https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/GPG-Bootcamp>

## Licenses üßæ

The different repositories may have one or more licenses. These licenses can be found in a markdown file called "LICENSE.md"  in the main folders. In addition to this file, you may also find a folder called "Licensing". This folder is common when there is more than one applicable license. This can be the case when there is for example code and media in the same repository.

## Paid Contributing & Hiring üë©‚Äçüíª üí∏ üë®‚Äçüíª

We are an Open Source Company with Open Source projects so anyone interested in contributing can do so.
We are looking for proactive, passionate and active contributors and if you are one we will notice you. It is very easy in an Open Source project.

If you make qualitative contributions that help the team move the projects forward these will speak for themselves.
Your contributions can take many forms, working code, new ideas for features, constructive comments in discussions, revisions, improvement suggestions, etc.

We do not care much about CVs, whether you are a rookie or a senior, anyone can add value.
It is your active collaboration that will speak for itself. When this is the case we will contact you and get to know you better and possibly offer different options.
