# Hi There 👋 --- Welcome to our Organization's GitHub Page

## Who We Are

We are currently a small team of people working towards our long term vision. Our vision is to create open source software ecosystems, with a particular focus on AI and Machine Learning solutions.
Our team is both made up of employees and external collaborators. We come from different professional backgrounds and countries. 
Most of us are developers but some of us are not.

Things that define us as a team are:
- The believe that everyone can add value
- The constant strive to learn and improve ourselves
- The believe that all we do has an impact on others and our planet
- The convincement that technology has great potential and value for individuals and companies

Essentially, we care for:
- People and the community
- Transparency
- Learning & sharing of knowledge
- The free availability of software and technology through Open-Source software
- The responsible use of technology
- Nature

Given this we strive to create value with everything that we and share it with the community and we operate according to these values.

## Where are we located

Our company headquarters are located in Grünwald, a beautiful small town just outside of Munich, Germany. However, almost all of us are working remotely and we have team members in different countries.
You will find us in Germany, Spain and China.

## Our Journey
We just started our journey together in 2021. We have just taken the first steps of our journey to realize our vision.

### Years 2022-2023
We intend to:
- Bring the power of AI directly to the end user on his local desktop with modular extensions and plaftorm to create these
- Create a community around our product and platform to further develop our vision and make it its own

All this so that the community learns, teaches and drives the direction and evolution of solutions, and this without any external influences.
