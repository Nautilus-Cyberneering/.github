# Hi There üëã --- Welcome to our Organization's GitHub Page

## Who We Are :smiley: :alien: :sunglasses: üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We are currently a small team of people working towards our long term vision. Our vision is to create open source software ecosystems, with a particular focus on AI and Machine Learning solutions.
Our team is both made up of employees and external collaborators. We come from different professional backgrounds and countries.
Most of us are developers but some of us are not.

Things that define us as a team are:

- The believe that everyone can add value
- The constant strive to learn and improve ourselves
- The believe that all we do has an impact on others and our planet
- The convincement that technology has great potential and value for individuals and companies

Essentially, we care for:

- People and the community
- Transparency
- Learning & sharing of knowledge
- The free availability of software and technology through Open-Source software
- The responsible use of technology
- Nature

Given this we operate according to these values and we strive to create value with everything we do and share it with the community.

## Where are we located :earth_africa

Our company headquarters are located in Gr√ºnwald, a beautiful small town just outside of Munich, Germany. However, almost all of us are working remotely and we have team members in different countries.
You will find us in Germany, Spain and China.

## Our Journey :rocket

We just started our journey together in 2021. We have just taken the first steps of our journey to realize our vision.

### Years 2022-2023

We intend to:

- Bring the power of AI directly to the end user on his local desktop with modular extensions and a plaftorm to create these
- Create a community around our product and platform to further develop our vision and make it its own

All this so that the community learns, teaches and drives the direction and evolution of solutions, and this without any external influences.

## Our Projects  :bulb:

Each of our current projects has a specific purpose to address core elements that we need to learn to realize our long term vision.

### Long term Projects Overview  :telescope:  :dart:

This is a link to our [first long-term project's roadmap repository](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/ai_assistant_roadmap).

### Spin-off repositories with potential for general use

Along the way to develop our long term project we will require to develop custom solutions to challenges we face, which nevertheless, may be of use to the others.
The resulting products can take different forms but we list them under each Steppingstone project in a section called spin-offs.

### Current Stepping Stone Projects (SSP) :nut_and_bolt:

With everything we do we attempt to create value from the start.
In this case we are helping a collaborating company in solving one of their needs, and at the same time we are learning about one of the key components that we will require to realize our vision.

1. The Creation of a Simple Media Management System through GitHub Repositories - [read more](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/chinese-ideographs/blob/main/README.md)

Current Objectives:

- Become experts in managing large amounts of interlinked GitHub repositories
- Become experts in GitHub actions and workflows
- Become experts in version control system management for large binaries
- Become experts in Python
- Establish other necessary knowledge that needs to be acquired during the next project
- Solve our collaborator's need

Stage: POC02
